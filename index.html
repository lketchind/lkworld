            <p>I am Lemarr Ketchens, and I am a Software Engineer from the great city of Chicago, Illinois. Since the MySpace years, I have been interested in web development and how things work. I wanted to
                learn why certain images flicked or bounced while others were still. I want to know why typing numbers into certain fields would cause errors while other similar fields did not.
                My career path has put me in a position to work with a very diverse group of individuals (onshore and offshore), who were able to better explain the why. My willingness to learn has gotten
                teams in the past and current to understand that I am willing to work with others and very open to learning as well as sharing any knowledge that I have.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I have a few hobbies. These hobbies consist of dancing, Music / DJ-ing, fixing computers for friends/family, and reading about music & technology. A few of the reading
                subjects include:</p>
